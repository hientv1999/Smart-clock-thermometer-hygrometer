# Smart-clock-thermometer-hygrometer
## The motivation
This is my very first personal electronic project. I started my electronic hobby with the Arduino Uno R3. One of the most common projects that regular beginners usually start with this microcontroller are: 
* Displaying characters with *LCD1602 module*
* Monitoring temperature and humidity with *DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module*
* Motion sensing with *HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor Module*
* Time viewer with *DS1307 RTC module* and *4 Digit 7-Segment Display*

However, I wanted to make a special project that outclassed the above ones. Also, the projects must not use other modules other than the 5 mentioned modules above since I only have those in hands at that moment. Also, I desired to exploit the capability of the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller as much as I can. Therefore, I came up with this project to fully utilize the entire I/O pins of Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller and all modules I have.
