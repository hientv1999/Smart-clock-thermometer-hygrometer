## The motivation
This is my very first personal electronic project. I started my electronic hobby with the Arduino Uno R3. One of the most common projects that regular beginners usually start with this microcontroller are: 
1. Displaying characters with *LCD1602 Module*
2. Monitoring temperature and humidity with *DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module*
3. Motion sensing with *HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor Module*
4. Time display with *DS1307 RTC Module* and *4 Digit 7-Segment Display*
5. Sound activation with *KY-037 Sound Detection Sensor*

However, I wanted to make a special project that outclassed the above ones. Also, the projects must not use other modules other than the 6 mentioned modules above since I only have those in hands at that moment. Also, I desired to exploit the capability of the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller as much as I can. Therefore, I came up with this project to fully utilize the entire I/O pins of Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller and all modules I have.
## Description
The final project (under default) will be a device that can:
* Switch between the *LCD1602 Module* and *4 Digit 7-Segment Display* to show the information based on the presence of the user.
* Under default, the device will display the time under 24-hour format via the *4 Digit 7-Segment Display* for easier visibility.
* If the user stays closer than 3 meters from the device, the device will switch to the *LCD1602 Module* to display time for 10 seconds and then, temperature and humidity readings for 10 seconds.
* *LCD1602 Module* will be turned off after 10 seconds to save power.
* *LCD1602 Module* can always be activated by motion within 3 meters or hand clap.
* Single clap for showing Time reading only for 10 seconds.
* Double clap for showing temperature and humidity readings only for 10 seconds.

***Bonus: RGB LEDs will be added to make device's look more attractive***

## Procedure
1. Hardware connections

I'm using KiCad to make the schematic for this project. You can either print it onto a PCB or wire everything on the breadboard.

[Access KiCad folder](https://github.com/hientv1999/Smart-clock-thermometer-hygrometer/blob/main/PCB)

![Schematic](https://github.com/hientv1999/Smart-clock-thermometer-hygrometer/blob/main/Schematic.PNG)
2. Programming

In this project, I use Arduino IDE for beginner's convenience. It is a free software and most tinkering beginner will be familiar with.

You may wish to install some libraries: 
* [IRRemote.h](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/z3t0/IRremote-2.8.1.zip)
* [dht.h](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/adafruit/DHT_sensor_library-1.4.1.zip)
* [LiquidCrystal.h](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal-1.0.7.zip)
* [RTClib.h](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/adafruit/RTClib-1.12.4.zip)
* [SevSeg.h](https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/DeanIsMe/SevSeg-3.5.0.zip). 

Click on the name of the library in blue color to download it. After downloading, in your Arduino IDE, go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library. Then browse and select the library you just downloaded.

***The RTC timer of the device will be set based on the timer of the computer you used to upload the code onto Arduino board***

***Loudness and speed of clap can be customized in the code***
