# Smart-clock-thermometer-hygrometer
## The motivation
This is my very first personal electronic project. I started my electronic hobby with the Arduino Uno R3. One of the most common projects that regular beginners usually start with are: 
* *Displaying characters with LCD1602 module*
* *Monitoring temperature and humidity with DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module*
* *Motion sensing with HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor Module*
* *Time viewer with DS1307 RTC module and 4 Digit 7-Segment Display*

However, I wanted to make a special project that outclassed the above ones. Also, the projects must not use other modules other than the 5 mentioned modules above since I only have those in hands at that moment. Also, I desired to exploit the capability of the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller as much as I can. Therefore, I came up with this project to fully utilize the entire I/O pins of Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller and all modules I have.
